// Arithmetic Operators
/* 
  +$a  Identity Conversion of $a to int or float as appropriate.
  -$a	Negation	Opposite of $a.
  $a + $b	Addition	Sum of $a and $b.
  $a - $b	Subtraction	Difference of $a and $b.
  $a * $b	Multiplication	Product of $a and $b.
  $a / $b	Division	Quotient of $a and $b.
  $a % $b	Modulo	Remainder of $a divided by $b.
  $a ** $b	Exponentiation	Result of raising $a to the $b'th power. 
  
*/


// Increment/decrement Operators
/*   
++$a	Pre-increment	Increments $a by one, then returns $a.
$a++	Post-increment	Returns $a, then increments $a by one.
--$a	Pre-decrement	Decrements $a by one, then returns $a.
$a--	Post-decrement	Returns $a, then decrements $a by one.
